Tuple
If a StringField is whitespace to toString method could get screwed up.
The .fields method should be .iterator to follow conventions.
Tuple implements Iterable<TDItem>

TupleDesc
TupleDesc implements Iterable<TDItem>
TupleDesc.getFieldName/getFieldType throws NoSuchElementException instead of the proper IndexOutOfBoundsException
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex doesn't match naming convention of other methods. getIndexByName is better.
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex should return -1 if not found, not throw an exception. They're slow and poor style.

Classes don't test instanceof in .equals methods.
