addTable calls the other addTable with "". "" is a valid table name. You could accidentally name a primary key.
addTable with no name calls addTable with a randomly generated String. This could be a duplicate. It should test that
    it's unique first.
iterator instead of tableIdIterator.

Tuple
If a StringField is whitespace to toString method could get screwed up.
The .fields method should be .iterator to follow conventions.
Tuple implements Iterable<TDItem>

TupleDesc
TupleDesc implements Iterable<TDItem>
TupleDesc.getFieldName/getFieldType throws NoSuchElementException instead of the proper IndexOutOfBoundsException
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex doesn't match naming convention of other methods. getIndexByName is better.
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex should return -1 if not found, not throw an exception. They're slow and poor style.

Classes don't test instanceof in .equals methods.
NoSuchElementException is an UNCHECKED exception. It does NOT belong in the method header!
