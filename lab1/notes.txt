addTable calls the other addTable with "". "" is a valid field name. You could accidentally name a primary key.
addTable with no name calls addTable with a randomly generated String. This could be a duplicate. It should test that
    it's unique first.
iterator instead of tableIdIterator.

DbFile
.writePage javadoc says PageId has a method pageno, when it's pageNumber.

DbFileIterator/DbIterator
Next should throw IllegalStateException when not open, not NoSuchElementException.

HeapFile
Hashing does NOT gaurantee uniqueness!
readPage should have throws IOException. FileNotFoundException is NOT the only IOException.

HeapPage
FIELDS SHOULD BE PRIVATE.
The iterator doesn't specify that it needs to be in the order as on disk, but the tests enforce that.
Why assume that a parse exception means that there isn't another Tuple?
Why does this take only a HeapPageId? It is LITERALLY no different from a PageId and there's no reason not to!

Page
This should be Iterable. Or at least have the .iterator method so we don't have to cast.

PageId
.pageNumber doesn't fit the standard naming convention. It should be getPageNumber.
Why is this an interface? This should be a class. There is no other information necessary and if needed, it could be
    added with a subclass. HeapPageId should just be PageId.

RecordId
.tupleno doesn't fit standard naming conventions. Should be getTupleNo.

Tuple
If a StringField is whitespace toString method could get screwed up and cause errors during parsing.
The .fields method should be .iterator to follow conventions.
Tuple implements Iterable<Field>

TupleDesc
TupleDesc implements Iterable<TDItem>
TupleDesc.getFieldName/getFieldType throws NoSuchElementException instead of the proper IndexOutOfBoundsException
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex doesn't match naming convention of other methods. getIndexByName is better.
TupleDesc.fieldNameToIndex should return -1 if not found, not throw an exception. They're slow and poor style.
TDItem fields should be private on public inner classes.

General
Classes don't test instanceof in .equals methods.
NoSuchElementException is an UNCHECKED exception. It does NOT belong in the method header!
The project doesn't use proper package namespacing conventions.
