Aggregate
The @link in the constructor says IntAggregator instead of IntegerAggregator.
The constructor header should specify Aggregator#NO_GROUPING, not -1.
aggregateFieldName/groupFieldName doesn't follow standard naming.

Aggregator
You don't specify the behavior if the results are empty.
The naming convention is off (and 'what' is a terrible name).
This should either take a TupleDesc or names for the columns so I don't have to implement it multiple times...

Field
Fields don't bother to check types before doing compare.
